# MachineLearningProjects
Implementation of Machine learning techniques on different Datasets in Python 3.  \
The first one is a regression problem on Superconductors dataset.
You can find a pdf presentation, in which I shortly described the entire project from the data preprocessing to results, and a jupyter notebook, which you can run for yourself. \
The Regression Models I used on Superconductors Dataset are: Linear Regression, Regularized Models, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost, Polynomial Regression. In addiction, I used three methods for dimensionality reduction: Variance Threshold, Sequenzial Backward Selection and Principal Component Analysis.\
