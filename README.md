# MachineLearningProjects
Application of Machine learning techniques in Python 3 for regression problem on Superconductors dataset. \
You can find a pdf presentation, in which I shortly described the entire project from the data preprocessing to results, and a jupyter notebook, which you can run for yourself. \
The Regression Models I used are: Linear Regression, Regularized Models, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost, Neural Networks.
