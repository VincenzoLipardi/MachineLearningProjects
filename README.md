# MachineLearningProjects
Application of Machine learning techniques for regression problem on Superconductors dataset. \n
You can find a pdf presentation in which I shortly described the entire project, from the data preprocessing to results. \n
The Regression Models I used are: Linear Regression, Regularized Models, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost, Neural Networks.
